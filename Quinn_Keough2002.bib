  abstract = {An experimental manipulation of density in the diadematid sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii demonstrated that the species has a large impact on the abundance of large brown algae, limpets and crustose coralline algae. Significant non-linearities were observed in these variables in response to the removal of all, 66 \%, 33 \% or no sea urchins from naturally occurring patches of Barrens habitat in New South Wales. Removal of all sea urchins caused the loss of the Barrens habitat and the development of an assemblage of foliose algae. Foliose algae did not successfully colonize treatments in which only some sea urchins were removed. Partial removals caused reductions in the size of patches that were not linearly related to density. Changes in size of patches were interpreted as being a complex product of the size and shape of crevices containing sea urchins.}

The distribution of native rodents in 25 urban habitat fragments was assessed by live-trapping. Over half of the fragments surveyed (13 of 25) did not support populations of native rodents. Fragments supported fewer species than equivalently sized plots in large expanses of unfragmented habitat, and older fragments (fragments that had been isolated for a longer period of time) supported fewer species. Both results implied that local extinctions occurred in the fragments following insularization. Stepwise multiple polychotomous logistic regression was used to determine which biogeographic variables were the best predictors of species number across fragments. The area of shrub habitat in each fragment was the most significant predictor of species diversity; age of a fragment was also significant and was negatively correlated with species number, but the isolation distance of a fragment had no relationship to species diversity. We found a negative relationship between extinction vulnerability of native rodent species and relative abundance: species that were more abundant in unfragmented habitat persisted in more habitat fragments. Random environmental and demographic fluctuations (island effects) and edge effects associated with fragmentation are proposed as causes of these local extinctions.},

This experiment was performed with H. erythrogramma specimens collected in January 1987 from Pt. Lillias in Corio Bay, Australia. Suture widths in the test and gonad volume were significantly less (relative to body volume) in Heliocidaris erythrogramma (Val.) in the low food treatment than the high food treatment after 4 mo. These results imply that sea urchins which shrink may have a poorer body condition and be less able to reproduce than sea urchins that do not shrink. A comparison of the expected to the observed changes in suture width showed that a decrease in suture width is involved in the shrinking of the test in H. erythrogramma and may be of sufficient magnitude to fully explain the observed reduction in test size. This suggests that the amount a sea urchin may shrink under low food conditions is constrained by the degree to which the sutures can be reduced in width.},

In this study we examined the impact of fire on Geocrinia lutea by counting calling males in six pairs of burned and control sites from 1992 to 1994. The immediate impact of the fire on G. lutea adults, and the survival of G. lutea eggs and larvae after the fire, were also addressed. We found that fuel-reduction burning in spring was associated with a significant decline in the number of calling males. The populations had not recovered two years after the fire. Up to 29\% of the calling males may have been killed in the fire. Egg and larval survival was not significantly different between treatments. However, the treatments did differ in the cause of death, with higher in-situ egg death and lower predation at burned sites. The short-term impact of spring fuel-reduction burns may pose a serious threat of extinction for very small populations. The endangered species Geocrinia alba has many small, isolated populations and frequent fire may therefore be inimical to their survival. However, we do not know if there is a long-term effect. Populations may or may not have time to recover between fires.},

We studied vertebrate-dispersed species in fire-prone sclerophyll vegetation to look at mechanisms used by vertebrate-dispersed plants for persisting in these environments. Seeds do not survive heating to 150\textdegree C, although species from fire-prone environments are more likely to tolerate moderate heating (80\textdegree C) without affecting viability than vertebrate-dispersed species from environments where fire is rare. Most vertebrate-dispersed species have the capacity to regenerate vegetatively, although they are not more likely to have this strategy than ant-dispersed species. Finally, ants do take vertebrate-dispersed seeds and fruits (particularly small ones) indicating the potential for the formation of a soil seed-bank. Some species only persist in fire-prone environments by recolonizing from unburnt areas.},

Although some labeled Northern Fulmars showed marked differences in behavior compared to controls. FMR did not change correspondingly. At-sea FMR averaged 1444 kJ/d, equivalent to 4.5 \texttimes{} basal metabolic rate (BMR). As a multiple of BMR it was independent of sex, wing length, body mass, mass change, and duration of the period at sea, but was strongly dependent on wind speed, being higher during slack winds. There was also a trend for higher wingbeat frequency at winds to low for sustained dynamic soaring. The high energetic cost of flapping flight during windless conditions may explain patterns of nest attendance: in particular, why nest site attendance by Northern Fulmars in winter is greater during calm weather. Lack of wind might limit the breeding range of this species and other Procellariiformes with high flapping-flight costs.}

Red crabs are diurnally active, and moisture appears to be the most important factor governing surface activity \textendash{} activity was nil below 77\% RH, relatively low at 87\% RH, and high above 95\% RH. The crabs retreat to the interior of their burrows during dry periods, but emerge rapidly in response to rain. Because of their dependence on moisture for surface activity, red crabs show greater levels of activity during the wet season. Annual breeding migrations and moulting activity decreased the density of surface-active crabs at the main study sites for several weeks at the start of the wet season, and fruit and leaf fall caused dramatic local increases in the density of active red crabs. Density and biomass at the main study sites averaged 1.3 crabs m-2 and 1454 kg ha-1, respectively, and 1.2 crabs m-2 and 1137 kg ha-1 at a total of five sites across the island. Rough calculations suggest that the island-wide population is at least 100 million individuals. Red crabs are the dominant consumer on the forest floor, and consume seeds, seedlings and leaf litter. Because they are both abundant and widespread, these animals have the potential to be the most important determinant of pattern and process in rain forest on Christmas Island.},

Disturbances of four different intensities were applied experimentally over six summers, with no human access at other times of the year. The dominant intertidal plant, the brown alga Hormosira banksii, was affected by trampling, but the effects were heterogeneous between sites. At two sites, a series of pulse disturbances produced a series of pulse responses, although the effect of a given pulse varied among years, possibly related to the severity of summer desiccating conditions each year. At the third site, pulse disturbances produced a press response; at high levels of trampling, Hormosira was almost eliminated within 2 yr, and at two intermediate levels of trampling, cover was reduced from {$>$}90 to 60-70\%, where it remained for 4 yr. Effects of trampling showed little small-scale spatial variation. Untrampled areas did fluctuate through time, often as a result of summer burnoff of algae. Natural disturbances occurred irregularly through the study, and their effects varied on very small spatial scales (among plots {$<$}30 m apart). Trampling enhanced the densities of a range of herbivorous mollusks, especially limpets, and reduced the abundance of articulated coralline algae, which were abundant in the understory of Hormosira mats. These effects varied among sites but showed much less variation on smaller spatial scales. The reductions in coralline algae may be a direct effect of trampling, but increases in mollusk abundance occurred some time after changes to Hormosira cover, and those changes may be an indirect effect of trampling. We compared the effects of trampling on areas of the shore that had been trampled for two and four summers, to test whether a past history of disturbance influenced the effect of a new disturbance. No significant effects were found on algae or mobile animals, although a mild summer may have made our test of history relatively weak. Hormosira banksii fits the definition of a keystone species or engineer and, as such, is an appropriate focus for management and as an indicator. Spatially heterogeneous effects of a constant physical perturbation, however, mean that management of these rocky shores requires more complex models and indicate that caution should be used in adopting this species as a uniform indicator of environmental change.}

  abstract = {Larvae of benthic invertebrates are exposed to a variety of chemical cues, many of biological origin, as they near a potential settlement surface. One such cue is the bioorganic film that covers many surfaces, and some laboratory evidence suggests that larvae respond to the presence or absence of such films. Our earlier work has shown that, at two field sites in southeastern Australia, a variety of species recruit at higher densities to substrata bearing such a film, and here we begin to determine the specificity of those responses. Experimental substrata were prepared with films developing in laboratory aquaria and under field conditions for 7 days. These substrata were then exposed in the field, and analysis of 19 sessile taxa, distributed over seven phyla, showed that no species recruited at significantly different densities onto surfaces of these two origins. Field films were prepared by covering substrata with plankton meshes, to exclude larvae, and additional laboratory treatments showed that such handling does not produce different recruitment from that onto substrata that were unnetted. One further experimental treatment was plates that had been placed in sterile seawater, and recruitment onto these surfaces confirmed that both field and laboratory films did have positive (and negative) effects on recruitment. In a second experiment, we prepared laboratory microbial films of four ages: 0, 1, 3, and 6 days. These substrata were immersed in the field for 3 and 6 days in a balanced experiment. Recruitment rates varied significantly with age of film for five of 13 taxa. Two polychaete species and two arborescent bryozoans (Bugula stolonifera and Bugula neritina) showed a positive relationship, and the barnacle Balanus variegatus recruited in greater numbers onto less filmed surfaces. Seven other taxa, including one protozoan, a sponge, and five ascidian taxa, showed no relationship with age of microbial film, despite high recruitment rates of these taxa. Summed across all taxa, total recruitment increased with age of film, almost doubling from unfilmed surfaces to those that began the field period with 6-day-old films. Comparison of 3- and 6-day field immersion periods showed that mean daily recruitment of some species, including a number of those responding to the presence of films, was higher on substrata left in the field for 6-days. Some of these patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that laboratory-derived films become supplemented by further microbial organisms in the field, making them even more attractive to settling larvae. An alternative hypothesis, that higher recruitment onto plates immersed for 6 days reflects temporally patchy recruitment, with pulses of recruitment in the latter half of the experimental period, could not be rejected. The experiments show that under field conditions, invertebrate larvae settle at very different rates onto surfaces differing only in the composition of the microbial community. Such settlement choices may be important in determining recolonization sequences following small-scale disturbances.},

This result, when used in conjunction with the distributions of {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$}, proved incompatible with existing models of habitat occupancy patterns. The correlation between {$\beta$} and average density, and between {$\gamma$} and average density, each was approximately zero, results that differed from the findings of other studies at the range-level geographic scale.

Using seven isozyme-encoding loci as genetic markers, we assessed the amount and distribution of genetic variation among three populations and eight subpopulations. Total genetic variation was lower than in species with similar life history traits but equivalent to that of other endemic plants. Spatial autocorrelation showed some evidence for very limited differentiation within subpopulations at a scale of 1-2 m. The subpopulations, separated by tens of meters, were found to be more differentiated from each other (F\textsubscript{sp} = 0.084) on average than were populations (F\textsubscript{pt}= 0.017). This local genetic differentiation was not correlated with physical distance between subpopulations. The low F\textsubscript{pt} estimates suggest that substantial gene flow is occurring among populations. However, the lack of correlation between genetic and geographic distances and the significant differentiation of subpopulations suggest that genetic drift is occurring within populations. Therefore, we believe the apparent homogeneity of populations is due to each population's gene frequencies' being an average of several divergent subpopulations. If drift is causing differentiation within populations, it may eventually cause differentiation between populations. The importance of using a hierarchical approach to evaluating genetic structure is clear. Patterns occurring at one spatial scale may not be evident at others. One should not necessarily conclude that gene flow is substantial and that the risk of genetic erosion via drift is negligible just because differentiation between populations is small; the system may not be at equilibrium. This lesson is particularly important when recent changes in climate or land use are apparent.}

Responses of diatom communities to Zn in six metal-polluted streams were influenced by elevation and other variables correlated with the stream's longitudinal gradient (pH, conductivity, alkalinity). Although clear community responses were observed at sites where Zn concentration exceeded 200 {$\mu$}g/L, effects of metals at moderately polluted sites were not significant. These field results were compared to responses of periphyton communities in experimental streams dosed with heavy metals. We hypothesized that communities collected from high elevation sites, which were dominated by early successional species (A. minutissima), would be more tolerant to metals than downstream communities. To test this hypothesis, diatom communities collected from a high elevation site (2340 m) and a low elevation site (1536 m) on the Cache la Poudre River were exposed to a mixture of Cd, Cu, and Zn in experimental streams. Small, adnate species (Achnanthes minutissima and Fragilaria vaucheriae) were tolerant to metals and increased in abundance in treated streams. In contrast, late successional species, which were found only at the low elevation site (Diatoma vulgare and Melosira varians), were highly sensitive to metals and were eliminated from treated streams after 24 h. These results indicate that natural variation in diatom communities may complicate interpretation of routine biomonitoring studies. We suggest that it may be useful to study periphyton community responses to pollutants in relation to ecological characteristics and morphological growth forms. Conducting research within this framework may improve the predictive ability of periphyton models and provide a theoretical basis for understanding the relationships between community patterns and the evolutionary processes that determine responses to disturbance.}

  abstract = {In temperate mangrove forests in New South Wales, Australia, the limpet Patelloida mimula Iredale lives on the oyster Saccostrea commercialis Iredale and Roughley, which, along with mangrove trees, provide the only hard substrata in a habitat otherwise dominated by soft-sediment. The objective of this study was to ascertain the degree of association between the limpet and the oyster by examining their patterns of co-occurrence in the forest and the relationship between individual pairs of limpets and oysters. Sampling of the distribution and abundance of limpets and oysters throughout the mangrove forest revealed that limpets were rarely present on substrata other than oysters. Patterns of abundance of limpets were, however, not directly related to the amount of habitat provided by the oysters. For example, there was a dramatic decline in the abundance of oysters from seaward to landward in the mangrove forest which was not reflected in the densities of limpets. Consequently, oysters appear to set the limits of distribution of limpets, but other factors modify their broad-scale patterns of distribution and abundance within these bounds. Limpets leave scars on oysters which might be home sites. About 98\% of oysters with limpets had only one limpet per surface of oyster, and the distribution of limpets was overdispersed or repulsed. Moreover, in some areas of the forest, the lengths of limpets were directly related to lengths of oysters. Tracking of individual limpets for 13 days revealed that {$>$} 70\% remained on the same scar of an oyster. This evidence suggests that for some limpets there is a strong association with particular oysters. Factors determining the distribution, abundance, and sizes of oysters are likely to be important sources of variation to the structure of populations of P. mimula in temperate mangrove forests.},

It has been widely accepted that temperature is the principal control on the distribution of C\$\_3\$ and C\$\_4\$ species. Our results show that precipitation and its seasonal distribution are also important. C\$\_4\$ grass distribution was positively related to three climatic variables: mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, and the proportion of the precipitation falling in summer. These variables accounted for 66\% of the total variability of this functional type. C\$\_3\$ grass abundance decreased with mean annual temperature and increased with the proportion of the precipitation falling during winter (\$r\^2\$ = 0.37). Sixty-two percent of the variability in the relative abundance of shrubs was explained by mean annual precipitation and the proportion of winter precipitation. Latitude and longitude explained a substantial portion of the variability of the distribution of the relative abundance of shrubs, C\$\_3\$ grasses, and C\$\_4\$ grasses (53, 46, and 61\%, respectively). Along a given longitude, C\$\_3\$ grasses increased with latitude. As one moves westward, C\$\_4\$ grasses are replaced by shrubs. The relative abundance of C\$\_4\$ grasses reached a maximum at southern latitudes and eastern longitudes. Succulents showed a marginal decreasing trend with latitude.

We collected clumps in four seasons - autumn, winter, spring and summer - from a rocky shore in south-eastern Australia. Positive curvilinear relationships between species number and area were recorded for all seasons but fewer species for a given area were found in autumn and summer compared with winter and spring. These species-area relationships were different from those predicted from a passive sampling model (Random Placement Model). Positive relationships between number of individuals and area were also recorded but these did not vary between seasons. There was no short-term difference (i.e. between phases of tide and day) in species or individual number in clumps. Seasonal variation, and small-scale spatial unpredictability, in recruitment patterns are potentially important determinants of species numbers in this system. The seasonal differences we have recorded for mussel clumps suggest that future studies on island systems, particularly in marine habitats, should consider temporal variation in species-area relationships and that conclusions from previous comparisons of species-area curves based on one-off sampling must only be tentative.}

  abstract = {Spider density on desert islands in the Gulf of California is a joint function of variable productivity (bottom-up effects) and consumer intensity (top-down effects). Data from 20 islands and five years (1990\textendash 1994) show that the cumulative productivity of islands, a sum of the input of marine detritus and terrestrial plant productivity, varies spatially and temporally. Marine inputs are a function of the perimeter/area ratio and are thus relatively greater on smaller islands. Land plant productivity, a function of precipitation, is negligible in most years but can increase greatly (10\textendash 160\texttimes{} in plant cover) with heavy rains from El Ni\~no events (e.g., 1992\textendash 1993). Consumer intensity is a function of the continual influence of predaceous scorpions and the sporadic occurrence of parasitoid spider wasps (Pompilidae); the importance of these factors varies greatly, both because scorpions are absent on some islands and because parasitoid densities show extreme year-to-year oscillations. El Ni\~no rains produced large changes in the quantity and quality of plant resources and the control of spider populations. Spider densities doubled in 1992 in response to high levels of prey that followed heavy rains but crashed in 1993, despite continued high plant productivity and prey availability. The appearance of copious nectar and pollen, food of adult parasitoid wasps, caused wasp populations to erupt in 1993. Wasps emerged as a major, but previously hidden, trophic influence and greatly suppressed spider populations. Pompilids act as nonequilibrium agents\textemdash they are regulated by factors other than prey (spider) availability. In general, smaller spider populations were more variable year to year in the magnitude of their increases and decreases. In spite of the great temporal and spatial variability, consistent changes in plant, prey, spider, and wasp dynamics occurred repeatedly and apparently independently on islands throughout the archipelago. Such patterns of concerted change strongly suggest that general processes related to productivity and consumption are key to understanding the dynamics of this system.},

  abstract = {Convergence in interspecific leaf trait relationships across diverse taxonomic groups and biomes would have important evolutionary and ecological implications. Such convergence has been hypothesized to result from trade-offs that limit the combination of plant traits for any species. Here we address this issue by testing for biome differences in the slope and intercept of interspecific relationships among leaf traits: longevity, net photosynthetic capacity (Amax), leaf diffusive conductance (Gs), specific leaf area (SLA), and nitrogen (N) status, for more than 100 species in six distinct biomes of the Americas. The six biomes were: alpine tundra\textendash subalpine forest ecotone, cold temperate forest\textendash prairie ecotone, montane cool temperate forest, desert shrubland, subtropical forest, and tropical rain forest. Despite large differences in climate and evolutionary history, in all biomes mass-based leaf N (Nmass), SLA, Gs, and Amax were positively related to one another and decreased with increasing leaf life span. The relationships between pairs of leaf traits exhibited similar slopes among biomes, suggesting a predictable set of scaling relationships among key leaf morphological, chemical, and metabolic traits that are replicated globally among terrestrial ecosystems regardless of biome or vegetation type. However, the intercept (i.e., the overall elevation of regression lines) of relationships between pairs of leaf traits usually differed among biomes. With increasing aridity across sites, species had greater Amax for a given level of Gs and lower SLA for any given leaf life span. Using principal components analysis, most variation among species was explained by an axis related to mass-based leaf traits (Amax, N, and SLA) while a second axis reflected climate, Gs, and other area-based leaf traits.},

A peak in size class distribution showed a regeneration event at each location but at different times. The one in the swale was more recent and was dated to the mid-1970s using aerial photography. Young ({$<$} 5 m tall) trees, interpreted as recent regeneration, were concentrated on specific topographic features, the top of a steep riverbank and a sand mound separate from the main dune system. Access to these features would have been difficult after flooding suggesting regeneration is dependent on protection from introduced herbivores. Field observations of reproductive status and canopy die-back showed coolibah condition was better in the swale. The relatively poorer condition of floodplain coolibahs was attributed to saline soils compounded by drier conditions rather than age.},

Alternative hypotheses are @'predator regulation@' where predators hold the prey population well below starvation levels; and @'surplus@' predation where predators kill only those prey that are excluded from optimal habitat and are dying from starvation. The predictions from these hypotheses were tested by examining body condition of Serengeti Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) over 24 yr (1968-1991). Two phases of population growth were examined: 1968-1973 when the population was increased with superabundant food; and 1977-1991 when the population was stationary and regulated by intraspecific competition for food. Three categories of data were compared: live animals, predation kills, and nonpredation deaths. Body condition was measured from bone marrow, the last reserves of fat in ungulates. The predator regulation hypothesis predicts that the marrow condition should be similar to the predation and live samples. The surplus hypothesis predicts the predation and nonpredation samples should be similar. The PSF hypothesis predicts that marrow condition of the predation sample should be (1) poorer than that of the live sample, (2) better than that of the nonpredation sample, and (3) better when food is limiting than when it is abundant. Analyses of the frequency distribution of marrow categories showed that both the predation and nonpredation samples were significantly poorer than that of the live population. In both increase and stationary phases of population growth, the predation sample was in better condition than the nonpredation sample. The predation sample was not quite significantly better (P = 0.052) when food was limiting. These results are consistent with the PSF hypothesis and inconsistent with both of the alternative hypotheses. Female and male condition was similar in the predation sample, but females were killed at a younger age. Lions and hyenas killed animals in similar condition, but lions took animals at a younger age. The results suggest that (1) body condition affects the vulnerability of individual wildebeest to predation, and (2) predation jointly limits the population with intraspecific competition by removing animals from the population that are in better condition than those that are starving.}

  abstract = {This study investigated responses of populations of southern flying squirrels to a range of experimental even-aged and uneven-aged timber-harvest practices along a gradient of increasing disturbance intensity. The goals were to determine whether measurable demographic parameters of squirrels in experimental forests would change after logging; whether a disturbance threshold existed within the range of harvest practices implemented beyond which squirrels would not nest on a stand; and whether squirrels would show selection in the use of nest boxes in logged and unlogged habitats. Winter nest-box surveys were conducted in the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, USA, in 21 15-ha stands representing three replicated groups of six silvicultural treatments (pine\textendash hardwood single-tree selection, pine single-tree selection, pine\textendash hardwood shelterwood, pine shelterwood, pine\textendash hardwood seed tree, and pine seed tree), plus an unaltered control during 1993, prior to harvest, and after harvest in 1994\textendash 1996. Neither densities of nesting squirrels nor use of boxes for nests or feeding stations differed among treatment groups prior to harvests. Densities declined on all harvested stands after treatment in 1994; during the same period population growth was observed on control stands. A partial rebound in squirrels' use of nest boxes in some harvested stands occurred in 1995 and 1996. Prior to harvest, squirrels used boxes in all habitats in similar proportions. After logging, frequency of box use in greenbelt habitat (unharvested buffer strips along intermittent streams) was significantly greater than in harvested areas. On control stands the ratio of boxes used to those available did not change throughout the study. The ratio of boxes used per squirrel increased on harvested stands, even as squirrel densities declined, indicating a reduction in natural nesting resources after logging. The presence of mature forests adjacent to harvested stands, as well as retention of greenbelt habitat, overstory hardwoods, and snags within harvested areas, reduced the severity of logging impacts on flying squirrels. The seed-tree harvest regime, particularly without retained overstory hardwoods, appears to produce a level of disturbance and resource depletion that is too severe for flying squirrel persistence.},
